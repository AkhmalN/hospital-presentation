## About The Project

This application serves as an interactive presentation or briefing tool designed to showcase the functionalities of a conceptual or existing Hospital Management System. It aims to provide a clear and engaging way to walk stakeholders, clients, or team members through the different modules and processes involved in managing hospital operations, such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, billing, inventory, etc.

**Note:** This is a _presentation application_ and not the actual functional Hospital Management System itself.
